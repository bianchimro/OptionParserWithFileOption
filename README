The idea is adding a new option to option parser (-f or --from-file in my case).

This option does the following:

It concatenates all the lines of the given text file to create a new string of options
This set of options built from the text file is appended to the original set of options given at command line,(or viceversa, depending on a precedence setting).
Obviously the --from-file option must be checked first. At zero cost, I added the possibility to add comment lines to text options file, just to make them more lsverbose and let them seem a lot more like configuration files. This is simply done by ignoring lines that .startswith( ...) your comment delimiter, # in my case.
